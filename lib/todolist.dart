/// GENERAL APPROACH
/// HomeScreen shows a start session button, a calendar, and a list of historical sessions
/// 
/// 
/// FEATURES TO BUILD
/// DATA:
/// - save preset sessions in separate file or in memory.
/// - make list of new saved sessions, which you can add the preset sessions to
/// - expand list of exercises and blocks
/// - revisit data fields per model (session, block, exercises)
///   - add unique IDs
///   - sets, reps,  time between sets, time between reps
/// INTERACTION:
/// - adding new  session / workout (copy from previous build?)
/// - edit sets or reps during workout
/// - edit session once completed --> pop-up before logging
/// 
/// 
/// workflow: start session --> no saved sessions yet --> 
/// add sessions from preset list or add your own --> save savedSessions locally
/// 






// LATER STAGE
// - timers / progressions
// - timers without adding sessions/exercises first
// - user profiles
// - online mode (cloud storage)?
